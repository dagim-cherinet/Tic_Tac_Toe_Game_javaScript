## The algorithm is as follows:
1. I used 2D array represent every square in the tic tac toe game 

   let dataSet = [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []];
  
                          
2. everytime players make a move the app stores inside the inner array according to the correct coordinates [x][y]
3. and everytime a player make a move the app check the array to decide if that particular player wins or not
